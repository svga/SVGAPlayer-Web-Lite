# Skill Management CLI

Meta-skill for managing oh-my-codex skills via CLI-like commands.

## Subcommands

### /skill list

Show all local skills organized by scope.

**Behavior:**
1. Scan user skills at `~/.codex/skills/`
2. Scan project skills at `.codex/skills/`
3. Parse YAML frontmatter for metadata
4. Display in organized table format:

```
USER SKILLS (~/.codex/skills/):
| Name              | Triggers           | Quality | Usage | Scope |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------|-------|-------|
| error-handler     | fix, error         | 95%     | 42    | user  |
| api-builder       | api, endpoint      | 88%     | 23    | user  |

PROJECT SKILLS (.codex/skills/):
| Name              | Triggers           | Quality | Usage | Scope   |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------|-------|---------|
| test-runner       | test, run          | 92%     | 15    | project |
```

**Fallback:** If quality/usage stats not available, show "N/A"

---

### /skill add [name]

Interactive wizard for creating a new skill.

**Behavior:**
1. **Ask for skill name** (if not provided in command)
   - Validate: lowercase, hyphens only, no spaces
2. **Ask for description**
   - Clear, concise one-liner
3. **Ask for triggers** (comma-separated keywords)
   - Example: "error, fix, debug"
4. **Ask for argument hint** (optional)
   - Example: "<file> [options]"
5. **Ask for scope:**
   - `user` → `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
   - `project` → `.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
6. **Create skill file** with template:

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <description>
triggers:
  - <trigger1>
  - <trigger2>
argument-hint: "<args>"
---

# <Name> Skill

## Purpose

[Describe what this skill does]

## When to Activate

[Describe triggers and conditions]

## Workflow

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Examples

```
/oh-my-codex:<name> example-arg
```

## Notes

[Additional context, edge cases, gotchas]
```

7. **Report success** with file path
8. **Suggest:** "Edit `/skill edit <name>` to customize content"

**Example:**
```
User: /skill add custom-logger
Assistant: Creating new skill 'custom-logger'...

Description: Enhanced logging with structured output
Triggers (comma-separated): log, logger, logging

✓ Created skill at ~/.codex/skills/custom-logger/SKILL.md
→ Edit with: /skill edit custom-logger
```

---

### /skill remove <name>

Remove a skill by name.

**Behavior:**
1. **Search for skill** in both scopes:
   - `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
   - `.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
2. **If found:**
   - Display skill info (name, description, scope)
   - **Ask for confirmation:** "Delete '<name>' skill from <scope>? (yes/no)"
3. **If confirmed:**
   - Delete entire skill directory (e.g., `~/.codex/skills/<name>/`)
   - Report: "✓ Removed skill '<name>' from <scope>"
4. **If not found:**
   - Report: "✗ Skill '<name>' not found in user or project scope"

**Safety:** Never delete without explicit user confirmation.

**Example:**
```
User: /skill remove old-logger
Assistant: Found skill 'old-logger' in user scope:
  Description: Legacy logging utility

**Behavior:**
1. **Scan both scopes:**
   - User skills: `~/.codex/skills/`
   - Project skills: `.codex/skills/`
2. **Compare and categorize:**
   - User-only skills (not in project)
   - Project-only skills (not in user)
   - Common skills (in both)
3. **Display sync opportunities:**

```
SYNC REPORT:

User: yes
Assistant: ✓ Copied 'error-handler' to .codex/skills/

Copy 'api-builder' from user to project? (yes/no/skip)
User: skip
...
```

---

### /skill setup

Interactive wizard for setting up and managing local skills (formerly local-skills-setup).

**Behavior:**

#### Step 1: Directory Check and Setup

First, check if skill directories exist and create them if needed:

```bash
# Check and create user-level skills directory
USER_SKILLS_DIR="$HOME/.codex/skills"
if [ -d "$USER_SKILLS_DIR" ]; then
  echo "User skills directory exists: $USER_SKILLS_DIR"
else
  mkdir -p "$USER_SKILLS_DIR"
  echo "Created user skills directory: $USER_SKILLS_DIR"
fi

# Check and create project-level skills directory
PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR=".codex/skills"
if [ -d "$PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR" ]; then
  echo "Project skills directory exists: $PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR"
else
  mkdir -p "$PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR"
  echo "Created project skills directory: $PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR"
fi
```

#### Step 2: Skill Scan and Inventory

Scan both directories and show a comprehensive inventory:

```bash
# Scan user-level skills
echo "=== USER-LEVEL SKILLS (~/.codex/skills/) ==="
if [ -d "$HOME/.codex/skills" ]; then
  USER_COUNT=$(find "$HOME/.codex/skills" -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
  echo "Total skills: $USER_COUNT"

  if [ $USER_COUNT -gt 0 ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "Skills found:"
    find "$HOME/.codex/skills" -name "*.md" -type f -exec sh -c '
      FILE="$1"
      NAME=$(grep -m1 "^name:" "$FILE" 2>/dev/null | sed "s/name: //")
      DESC=$(grep -m1 "^description:" "$FILE" 2>/dev/null | sed "s/description: //")
      MODIFIED=$(stat -c "%y" "$FILE" 2>/dev/null || stat -f "%Sm" "$FILE" 2>/dev/null)
      echo "  - $NAME"
      [ -n "$DESC" ] && echo "    Description: $DESC"
      echo "    Modified: $MODIFIED"
      echo ""
    ' sh {} \;
  fi
else
  echo "Directory not found"
fi

echo ""
echo "=== PROJECT-LEVEL SKILLS (.codex/skills/) ==="
if [ -d ".codex/skills" ]; then
  PROJECT_COUNT=$(find ".codex/skills" -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
  echo "Total skills: $PROJECT_COUNT"

  if [ $PROJECT_COUNT -gt 0 ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "Skills found:"
    find ".codex/skills" -name "*.md" -type f -exec sh -c '
      FILE="$1"
      NAME=$(grep -m1 "^name:" "$FILE" 2>/dev/null | sed "s/name: //")
      DESC=$(grep -m1 "^description:" "$FILE" 2>/dev/null | sed "s/description: //")
      MODIFIED=$(stat -c "%y" "$FILE" 2>/dev/null || stat -f "%Sm" "$FILE" 2>/dev/null)
      echo "  - $NAME"
      [ -n "$DESC" ] && echo "    Description: $DESC"
      echo "    Modified: $MODIFIED"
      echo ""
    ' sh {} \;
  fi
else
  echo "Directory not found"
fi

# Summary
TOTAL=$((USER_COUNT + PROJECT_COUNT))
echo "=== SUMMARY ==="
echo "Total skills across all directories: $TOTAL"
```

#### Step 3: Quick Actions Menu

After scanning, use the AskUserQuestion tool to offer these options:

**Question:** "What would you like to do with your local skills?"

**Options:**
1. **Add new skill** - Start the skill creation wizard (invoke `/skill add`)
2. **List all skills with details** - Show comprehensive skill inventory (invoke `/skill list`)
3. **Scan conversation for patterns** - Analyze current conversation for skill-worthy patterns
4. **Import skill** - Import a skill from URL or paste content
5. **Done** - Exit the wizard

**Option 3: Scan Conversation for Patterns**

Analyze the current conversation context to identify potential skill-worthy patterns. Look for:
- Recent debugging sessions with non-obvious solutions
- Tricky bugs that required investigation
- Codebase-specific workarounds discovered
- Error patterns that took time to resolve

Report findings and ask if user wants to extract any as skills (invoke `/learner` if yes).

**Option 4: Import Skill**

Ask user to provide either:
- **URL**: Download skill from a URL (e.g., GitHub gist)
- **Paste content**: Paste skill markdown content directly

Then ask for scope:
- **User-level** (~/.codex/skills/) - Available across all projects
- **Project-level** (.codex/skills/) - Only for this project

Validate the skill format and save to the chosen location.

### /skill scan

Quick command to scan both skill directories (subset of `/skill setup`).

**Behavior:**
Run the scan from Step 2 of `/skill setup` without the interactive wizard.

---

## Skill Templates

When creating skills via `/skill add` or `/skill setup`, offer quick templates for common skill types:

### Error Solution Template

```markdown
---
id: error-[unique-id]
name: [Error Name]
description: Solution for [specific error in specific context]
source: conversation
triggers: ["error message fragment", "file path", "symptom"]
quality: high
---

# [Error Name]

## The Insight
What is the underlying cause of this error? What principle did you discover?

## Why This Matters
What goes wrong if you don't know this? What symptom led here?

## Recognition Pattern
How do you know when this applies? What are the signs?
- Error message: "[exact error]"
- File: [specific file path]
- Context: [when does this occur]

## The Approach
Step-by-step solution:
1. [Specific action with file/line reference]
2. [Specific action with file/line reference]
3. [Verification step]

## Example
\`\`\`typescript
// Before (broken)
[problematic code]

// After (fixed)
[corrected code]
\`\`\`
```

### Workflow Skill Template

```markdown
---
id: workflow-[unique-id]
name: [Workflow Name]
description: Process for [specific task in this codebase]
source: conversation
triggers: ["task description", "file pattern", "goal keyword"]
quality: high
---

# [Workflow Name]

## The Insight
What makes this workflow different from the obvious approach?

## Why This Matters
What fails if you don't follow this process?

## Recognition Pattern
When should you use this workflow?
- Task type: [specific task]
- Files involved: [specific patterns]
- Indicators: [how to recognize]

## The Approach
1. [Step with specific commands/files]
2. [Step with specific commands/files]
3. [Verification]

## Gotchas
- [Common mistake and how to avoid it]
- [Edge case and how to handle it]
```

### Code Pattern Template

source: conversation
triggers: ["code pattern", "file type", "problem domain"]
quality: high
---

# [Pattern Name]

## The Insight
What's the key principle behind this pattern?

## Why This Matters
What problems does this pattern solve in THIS codebase?

## Recognition Pattern
When do you apply this pattern?
- File types: [specific files]
- Problem: [specific problem]
- Context: [codebase-specific context]

## The Approach
Decision-making heuristic, not just code:
1. [Principle-based step]
2. [Principle-based step]

## Example
\`\`\`typescript
[Illustrative example showing the principle]
\`\`\`

## Anti-Pattern
What NOT to do and why:

source: conversation
triggers: ["system name", "integration point", "config file"]
quality: high
---

# [Integration Name]

## The Insight
What's non-obvious about how these systems connect?

## Why This Matters
What breaks if you don't understand this integration?

## Recognition Pattern
When are you working with this integration?
- Files: [specific integration files]
- Config: [specific config locations]
- Symptoms: [what indicates integration issues]

## The Approach
How to work with this integration correctly:
1. [Configuration step with file paths]

3. [Verification step]

## Gotchas
- [Integration-specific pitfall #1]
- [Integration-specific pitfall #2]
```

---

## Error Handling

**All commands must handle:**
- File/directory doesn't exist
- Permission errors
- Invalid YAML frontmatter
- Duplicate skill names
- Invalid skill names (spaces, special chars)

**Error format:**
```
✗ Error: <clear message>
→ Suggestion: <helpful next step>
```

---

## Usage Examples

```bash
# List all skills
/skill list

# Create a new skill
/skill add my-custom-skill

# Remove a skill
/skill remove old-skill

# Edit existing skill
/skill edit error-handler

# Search for skills
/skill search typescript error

# Get detailed info
/skill info my-custom-skill

# Sync between scopes
/skill sync

# Run setup wizard
/skill setup

# Quick scan
/skill scan
```

## Usage Modes

### Direct Command Mode

When invoked with an argument, skip the interactive wizard:

- `/skill list` - Show detailed skill inventory
- `/skill add` - Start skill creation (invoke learner)
- `/skill scan` - Scan both skill directories

### Interactive Mode

When invoked without arguments, run the full guided wizard.

---

## Benefits of Local Skills

**Automatic Application**: Codex detects triggers and applies skills automatically - no need to remember or search for solutions.

**Version Control**: Project-level skills (.codex/skills/) are committed with your code, so the whole team benefits.

**Evolving Knowledge**: Skills improve over time as you discover better approaches and refine triggers.

**Reduced Token Usage**: Instead of re-solving the same problems, Codex applies known patterns efficiently.

**Codebase Memory**: Preserves institutional knowledge that would otherwise be lost in conversation history.

---

## Skill Quality Guidelines

Good skills are:

1. **Non-Googleable** - Can't easily find via search
   - BAD: "How to read files in TypeScript"
   - GOOD: "This codebase uses custom path resolution requiring fileURLToPath"

2. **Context-Specific** - References actual files/errors from THIS codebase
   - BAD: "Use try/catch for error handling"
   - GOOD: "The aiohttp proxy in server.py:42 crashes on ClientDisconnectedError"

3. **Actionable with Precision** - Tells exactly WHAT to do and WHERE
   - BAD: "Handle edge cases"
   - GOOD: "When seeing 'Cannot find module' in dist/, check tsconfig.json moduleResolution"

4. **Hard-Won** - Required significant debugging effort
   - BAD: Generic programming patterns
   - GOOD: "Race condition in worker.ts - Promise.all at line 89 needs await"

## Tips for Users

- Run `/skill list` periodically to review your skill library
- After solving a tricky bug, immediately run learner to capture it
- Use project-level skills for codebase-specific knowledge
- Use user-level skills for general patterns that apply everywhere
- Review and refine triggers over time to improve matching accuracy

---

## Implementation Notes

1. **YAML Parsing:** Use frontmatter extraction for metadata
2. **File Operations:** Use Read/Write tools, never Edit for new files
3. **User Confirmation:** Always confirm destructive operations
4. **Clear Feedback:** Use checkmarks (✓), crosses (✗), arrows (→) for clarity
5. **Scope Resolution:** Always check both user and project scopes
6. **Validation:** Enforce naming conventions (lowercase, hyphens only)
