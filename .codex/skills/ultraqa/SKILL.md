# UltraQA Skill

[ULTRAQA ACTIVATED - AUTONOMOUS QA CYCLING]

## Overview

## GPT-5.5 Guidance Alignment

Use the shared workflow guidance pattern: outcome-first framing, concise visible updates for multi-step QA, local overrides for the active workflow branch, validation proportional to risk, explicit stop rules, and automatic continuation for safe reversible steps. Ask only for material, destructive, credentialed, external-production, or preference-dependent branches.

You are now in **ULTRAQA** mode - an autonomous QA cycling workflow that runs until your quality goal is met.

**Cycle**: qa-tester → architect verification → fix → repeat

## Goal Parsing

Parse the goal from arguments. Supported formats:

| Invocation | Goal Type | What to Check |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| `/ultraqa --tests` | tests | All test suites pass |
| `/ultraqa --build` | build | Build succeeds with exit 0 |
| `/ultraqa --lint` | lint | No lint errors |
| `/ultraqa --typecheck` | typecheck | No TypeScript errors |
| `/ultraqa --custom "pattern"` | custom | Custom success pattern in output |

If no structured goal provided, interpret the argument as a custom goal.

## Cycle Workflow

### Cycle N (Max 5)

1. **RUN QA**: Execute verification based on goal type
   - `--tests`: Run the project's test command
   - `--build`: Run the project's build command
   - `--lint`: Run the project's lint command
   - `--typecheck`: Run the project's type check command
   - `--custom`: Run appropriate command and check for pattern
   - `--interactive`: Use qa-tester for interactive CLI/service testing:
     ```
     delegate(role="qa-tester", tier="STANDARD", task="TEST:
     Goal: [describe what to verify]
     Service: [how to start]
     Test cases: [specific scenarios to verify]")
     ```

2. **CHECK RESULT**: Did the goal pass?
   - **YES** → Exit with success message
   - **NO** → Continue to step 3

3. **ARCHITECT DIAGNOSIS**: Spawn architect to analyze failure
   ```
   delegate(role="architect", tier="THOROUGH", task="DIAGNOSE FAILURE:
   Goal: [goal type]
   Output: [test/build output]
   Provide root cause and specific fix recommendations.")
   ```

4. **FIX ISSUES**: Apply architect's recommendations
   ```
   delegate(role="executor", tier="STANDARD", task="FIX:
   Issue: [architect diagnosis]
   Files: [affected files]
   Apply the fix precisely as recommended.")
   ```

5. **REPEAT**: Go back to step 1

## Exit Conditions

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Goal Met** | Exit with success: "ULTRAQA COMPLETE: Goal met after N cycles" |
| **Cycle 5 Reached** | Exit with diagnosis: "ULTRAQA STOPPED: Max cycles. Diagnosis: ..." |
| **Same Failure 3x** | Exit early: "ULTRAQA STOPPED: Same failure detected 3 times. Root cause: ..." |
| **Environment Error** | Exit: "ULTRAQA ERROR: [tmux/port/dependency issue]" |

## Observability

Output progress each cycle:
```
[ULTRAQA Cycle 1/5] Running tests...
[ULTRAQA Cycle 1/5] FAILED - 3 tests failing
[ULTRAQA Cycle 1/5] Architect diagnosing...
[ULTRAQA Cycle 1/5] Fixing: auth.test.ts - missing mock
[ULTRAQA Cycle 2/5] Running tests...
[ULTRAQA Cycle 2/5] PASSED - All 47 tests pass
[ULTRAQA COMPLETE] Goal met after 2 cycles
```

## State Tracking

Use `omx_state` MCP tools for UltraQA lifecycle state.

- **On start**:
  `state_write({mode: "ultraqa", active: true, current_phase: "qa", iteration: 1, started_at: "<now>"})`
- **On each cycle**:
  `state_write({mode: "ultraqa", current_phase: "qa", iteration: <cycle>})`
- **On diagnose/fix transitions**:
  `state_write({mode: "ultraqa", current_phase: "diagnose"})`
  `state_write({mode: "ultraqa", current_phase: "fix"})`
- **On completion**:
  `state_write({mode: "ultraqa", active: false, current_phase: "complete", completed_at: "<now>"})`
- **For resume detection**:
  `state_read({mode: "ultraqa"})`


## Scenario Examples

**Good:** The user says `continue` after the workflow already has a clear next step. Continue the current branch of work instead of restarting or re-asking the same question.

**Good:** The user changes only the output shape or downstream delivery step (for example `make a PR`). Preserve earlier non-conflicting workflow constraints and apply the update locally.

**Bad:** The user says `continue`, and the workflow restarts discovery or stops before the missing verification/evidence is gathered.

## Cancellation

User can cancel with `/cancel` which clears the state file.

## Important Rules

1. **PARALLEL when possible** - Run diagnosis while preparing potential fixes
2. **TRACK failures** - Record each failure to detect patterns
3. **EARLY EXIT on pattern** - 3x same failure = stop and surface
4. **CLEAR OUTPUT** - User should always know current cycle and status
5. **CLEAN UP** - Clear state file on completion or cancellation

## STATE CLEANUP ON COMPLETION

When goal is met OR max cycles reached OR exiting early, run `$cancel` or call:

`state_clear({mode: "ultraqa"})`

Use MCP state cleanup rather than deleting files directly.
