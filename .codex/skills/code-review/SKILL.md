# Code Review Skill

Conduct a thorough code review for quality, security, and maintainability with severity-rated feedback.

## When to Use

This skill activates when:
- User requests "review this code", "code review"
- Before merging a pull request
- After implementing a major feature
- User wants quality assessment

## GPT-5.5 Guidance Alignment

- Default to outcome-first progress and completion reporting: state the target result, evidence, validation status, and stop condition before adding process detail.
- Treat newer user task updates as local overrides for the active workflow branch while preserving earlier non-conflicting constraints.
- If correctness depends on additional inspection, retrieval, execution, or verification, keep using the relevant tools until the review is grounded; stop once enough evidence exists.
- Continue through clear, low-risk, reversible next steps automatically; ask only when the next step is materially branching, destructive, credentialed, external-production, or preference-dependent.

Delegates to the `code-reviewer` and `architect` agents in parallel for a two-lane review:

1. **Identify Changes**
   - Run `git diff` to find changed files
   - Determine scope of review (specific files or entire PR)

2. **Launch Parallel Review Lanes**
   - **`code-reviewer` lane** - owns spec compliance, security, code quality, performance, and maintainability findings
   - **`architect` lane** - owns the devil's-advocate / design-tradeoff perspective
   - Both lanes run in parallel and produce distinct outputs before final synthesis

3. **Review Categories**
   - **Security** - Hardcoded secrets, injection risks, XSS, CSRF
   - **Code Quality** - Function size, complexity, nesting depth
   - **Performance** - Algorithm efficiency, N+1 queries, caching
   - **Best Practices** - Naming, documentation, error handling
   - **Maintainability** - Duplication, coupling, testability

4. **Severity Rating**
   - **CRITICAL** - Security vulnerability (must fix before merge)
   - **HIGH** - Bug or major code smell (should fix before merge)
   - **MEDIUM** - Minor issue (fix when possible)
   - **LOW** - Style/suggestion (consider fixing)

5. **Architectural Status Contract**
   - **CLEAR** - No unresolved architectural blocker was found
   - **WATCH** - Non-blocking design/tradeoff concern that must appear in the final synthesis
   - **BLOCK** - Unresolved design concern that prevents a merge-ready verdict

6. **Specific Recommendations**
   - File:line locations for each issue
   - Concrete fix suggestions
   - Code examples where applicable

7. **Final Synthesis**
   - Combine the `code-reviewer` recommendation and the architect status into one final verdict
   - Deterministic merge gating rules:
     - If architect status is **BLOCK**, final recommendation is **REQUEST CHANGES**
     - Else if `code-reviewer` recommendation is **REQUEST CHANGES**, final recommendation is **REQUEST CHANGES**
     - Else if architect status is **WATCH**, final recommendation is **COMMENT**
     - Else final recommendation follows the `code-reviewer` lane
   - The final report must make architect blockers impossible to miss

## Agent Delegation

```
delegate(
  role="code-reviewer",
  tier="THOROUGH",
  prompt="CODE REVIEW TASK

Review code changes for quality, security, and maintainability.

This is the code/spec/security lane. Do not absorb architectural ownership.

Scope: [git diff or specific files]

Review Checklist:
- Security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Code quality (complexity, duplication)
- Performance issues (N+1, inefficient algorithms)
- Best practices (naming, documentation, error handling)
- Maintainability (coupling, testability)

Output: Code review report with:
- Files reviewed count
- Issues by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Specific file:line locations
- Fix recommendations
- Approval recommendation (APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / COMMENT)"
)

delegate(
  role="architect",
  tier="THOROUGH",
  prompt="ARCHITECTURE / DEVIL'S-ADVOCATE REVIEW TASK

Review the same code changes from the architecture/tradeoff perspective.

Scope: [git diff or specific files]

Focus:
- System boundaries and interfaces
- Hidden coupling or long-term maintainability risks
- Tradeoff tension the main reviewer might miss
- Strongest counterargument against approving as-is

Output:
- Architectural Status: CLEAR / WATCH / BLOCK
- File:line evidence for each concern
- Concrete tradeoff or design recommendation"
)

Run both lanes in parallel, then synthesize them with the deterministic rules above.
```

## External Model Consultation (Preferred)

The code-reviewer agent SHOULD consult Codex for cross-validation.

### Protocol
1. **Form your OWN review FIRST** - Complete the review independently
2. **Consult for validation** - Cross-check findings with Codex
3. **Critically evaluate** - Never blindly adopt external findings
4. **Graceful fallback** - Never block if tools unavailable

### When to Consult
- Security-sensitive code changes
- Complex architectural patterns
- Unfamiliar codebases or languages
- High-stakes production code

### When to Skip
- Simple refactoring
- Well-understood patterns
- Time-critical reviews
- Small, isolated changes

### Tool Usage
Before first MCP tool use, call `ToolSearch("mcp")` to discover deferred MCP tools.
Use `mcp__x__ask_codex` with `agent_role: "code-reviewer"`.
If ToolSearch finds no MCP tools, fall back to the `code-reviewer` agent.

**Note:** Codex calls can take up to 1 hour. Consider the review timeline before consulting.

## Output Format

```
CODE REVIEW REPORT
==================

Files Reviewed: 8
Total Issues: 12
Architectural Status: WATCH

CRITICAL (0)
-----------
(none)

HIGH (0)
--------
(none)

MEDIUM (7)
----------
1. src/api/auth.ts:42
   Issue: Email normalization logic is duplicated instead of reusing the shared helper
   Risk: Validation rules can drift between authentication paths
   Fix: Route both paths through the shared normalization helper

2. src/components/UserProfile.tsx:89
   Issue: Derived permissions are recalculated on every render
   Risk: Avoidable work during profile refreshes
   Fix: Memoize the derived permissions list or compute it upstream

3. src/utils/validation.ts:15
   Issue: Form-layer and server-layer validation messages are defined separately
   Risk: User-facing validation guidance can become inconsistent
   Fix: Share one validation message helper across both call sites

LOW (5)

ARCHITECTURE WATCHLIST
----------------------
- src/review/orchestrator.ts:88
  Concern: Review result synthesis relies on implicit ordering rather than an explicit blocker contract
  Status: WATCH
  Recommendation: Define deterministic merge gating before expanding reviewers

SYNTHESIS
---------
- code-reviewer recommendation: COMMENT
- architect status: WATCH
- final recommendation: COMMENT

RECOMMENDATION: COMMENT

Address any WATCH concerns before treating the change as merge-ready.
```

## Review Checklist

The `code-reviewer` lane checks:

### Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs sanitized
- [ ] SQL/NoSQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS prevention (escaped outputs)
- [ ] CSRF protection on state-changing operations
- [ ] Authentication/authorization properly enforced

### Code Quality
- [ ] Functions < 50 lines (guideline)
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity < 10
- [ ] No deeply nested code (> 4 levels)
- [ ] No duplicate logic (DRY principle)
- [ ] Clear, descriptive naming

### Performance
- [ ] No N+1 query patterns
- [ ] Appropriate caching where applicable
- [ ] Efficient algorithms (avoid O(n²) when O(n) possible)
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders (React/Vue)

### Best Practices
- [ ] Error handling present and appropriate
- [ ] Logging at appropriate levels
- [ ] Documentation for public APIs
- [ ] Tests for critical paths
- [ ] No commented-out code

## Architect Lane Checklist

The `architect` lane checks:

- [ ] Boundary or interface changes are explicit
- [ ] New coupling/tradeoff risks are surfaced
- [ ] Long-horizon maintainability concerns are evidence-backed
- [ ] Architectural status is one of `CLEAR`, `WATCH`, or `BLOCK`
- [ ] Any `BLOCK` concern cites the reason merge-ready status should be withheld

## Approval Criteria

**APPROVE** - `code-reviewer` returns APPROVE and architect status is `CLEAR`
**REQUEST CHANGES** - `code-reviewer` returns REQUEST CHANGES or architect status is `BLOCK`
**COMMENT** - `code-reviewer` returns COMMENT with architect status `CLEAR`, architect status is `WATCH`, or only LOW/MEDIUM improvements remain


## Scenario Examples

**Good:** The user says `continue` after the workflow already has a clear next step. Continue the current branch of work instead of restarting or re-asking the same question.

**Good:** The user changes only the output shape or downstream delivery step (for example `make a PR`). Preserve earlier non-conflicting workflow constraints and apply the update locally.

**Bad:** The user says `continue`, and the workflow restarts discovery or stops before the missing verification/evidence is gathered.

## Use with Other Skills

**With Team:**
```
/team "review recent auth changes and report findings"
```
Includes coordinated review execution across specialized agents.

**With Ralph:**
```
/ralph code-review then fix all issues
```
On the explicit Ralph path, review findings should flow into automatic fix follow-up without another permission prompt. Plain `code-review` itself remains read-only and does **not** promise auto-fix.

**With Ultrawork:**
```
/ultrawork review all files in src/
```
Parallel code review across multiple files.

## Best Practices

- **Review early** - Catch issues before they compound
- **Review often** - Small, frequent reviews better than huge ones
- **Address CRITICAL/HIGH first** - Fix security and bugs immediately
- **Consider context** - Some "issues" may be intentional trade-offs
- **Learn from reviews** - Use feedback to improve coding practices
